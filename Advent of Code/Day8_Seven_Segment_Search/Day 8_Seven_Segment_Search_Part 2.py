#numbers we can identify with no other information: 1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 6, 3, :
#from 4 we can identify 9 straight away as it is the only 6 letter digit that shares all of 4's letters
#we can also identify the bottom position
#we can identify 6 as it only contains f and not c
#when we know 6 we should be able to find 0 as it is the last 6 letter digit, we can also identify the middle section
#3 is the only 5 letter digit that contains f and c
#2 contains c
#5 contains f
