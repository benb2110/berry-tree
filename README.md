### Learning Python


Hi there, my name is **Ben** I am currently on a Python learning journey.

If you're new to my page please take a look at my first project which is a clone of the fun daily [Wordle Game](https://github.com/benb2110/berry-tree/tree/main/WordleGame)

Next up I have been completing coding challenges on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

Check out the solutions for some of my favourite problems.
